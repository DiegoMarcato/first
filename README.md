# first
My first repository after a long time without use git and github.

## quotes from philosophers that I like
"The lack of freedom never consists in being segregated, but rather in being in promiscuity, because the unspeakable torture is not being able to be alone." (Fiódor Dostoiévski)

"Perhaps there is only one deadly sin: impatience. Because of impatience, we were expelled from Paradise; because of impatience, we cannot return." (Franz Kafka)
